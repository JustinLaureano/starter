This file describes the best practices and conventions to be followed regarding controller classes within the Laravel application.

- Controllers should be Single Action Controllers (invokable) unless otherwise specified.
- Action classes should be dependency injected
- Responses should be in the form of a data collection, or api resource class, of some kind so that the type is known.

Example controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Domain\Messaging\Actions\GetPostsAction;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Http\Resources\PostCollection;

class GetPosts extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Handle the incoming request.
     */
    public function __invoke(string $user_uuid, GetPostsAction $action)
    {
        $posts = $action->handle($user_uuid);

        return new PostCollection($messages);
    }
}

```
